# Dynamic Tariffs in Distribution Grids

This is the first version of the dynamic tariffs in distribution grids project. Initially, the following notebooks matter:
- 00 Set Up Cases.ipynb: Here, the data saved in the input folder is generated and explained
- 01 Create Dynamic and Constant Profiles.ipynb: This is the heart of the project. Here, the individual households are optimized (either dynamic or constant, with respective regulatory settings). Based on the regulatory options, the file name is created and saved in the output folder.
- 02.3 Calculate indidivual profitability.ipynb: This serves as an initial analysis of households profits, based on saved results.
