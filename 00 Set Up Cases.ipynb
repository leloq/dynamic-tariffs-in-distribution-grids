    "# Setting up the empirical-based household load profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Setting up 500 profiles of households, based on empirical or semi-empirical data for the year 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heat pumps**: Water-to-water heat pump load profiles, based on Schlemminger et al. (2022)'s real-world profiles. Enriched to 500 profiles through the approach of Semmelmann et al. (2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Household data**: Finding the corresponding real-world household load profiles from Schlemminger et al. (2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Electric vehicles**: Real-world Norwegian electric vehicle charging profiles from Sørensen et al. (2021), preprocessed in `00 Preprocessing_EV_data.ipynb`. To come up with 500 profiles, load profiles are shifted between [-4,4] weeks. Profiles are shifted by full weeks only to ensure daily integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BESS sizes**: Power ratings and capacities of household battery energy storage systems (BESS) are taken from Semmelmann et al. (2024, unpublished), based on a realistic sample of German residential households. \n",
    "\n",
    "**PV load data**: From renewables.ninja for Hamelin in 2019, the city from which the heat pump and household load profiles are obtained, based on Pfenninger and Staffell (2016). PV sized equal to BESS capacit / h, corresponding to average German households, depicted in Truong et al. (2016). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The following output files are generated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HP profiles\n",
    "- HH profiles\n",
    "- PV profile normed on 1kW rated power\n",
    "- EV profiles\n",
    "- Household config: includes for 500 households: A) column of HP and B) HH profile C) BESS capacity (drawn based on distribution) D) BESS rated power (derived from capacity) E) PV power (derived from capacity)\n",
